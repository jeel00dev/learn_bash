# Bash Notes & Command Reference

This repository is a personal knowledge base for learning and practicing **Bash and Linux commands**.

It contains:

- Detailed explanations of commonly used commands
- Small Bash operators and syntax notes
- Experimental scripts and tests

This project is currently a **work in progress** and is mainly for personal use, but it may become more structured and beginner-friendly in the future.

## Directory Structure

```

├── commands/
│   ├── find.md

### commands/

The `commands/` directory contains detailed documentation for individual Linux/Bash commands.

Each file focuses on:

- Command usage
- Common options
- Practical examples

Examples:

- `grep.md` → filtering text
- `find.md` → file searching
- `streams.md` → stdin, stdout, stderr

### note.md

`note.md` is used for small but important Bash concepts, such as:

- `>` and `>>`
- `|`
- `:`
- redirections
- syntax that does not need a full document

### test/

The `test` is used for experimenting and testing commands before documenting them properly.

Nothing here is guaranteed to be clean or final.

## Status

- Build in Progress
- Structure may change
- Content is continuously updated
- Formatting improvements planned
